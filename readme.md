Peanut Butter Banana “Ice Cream”
This tasty twist on “ice cream” is made from only a few ingredients and includes no added sugar. Blended frozen bananas take on the creamy texture of traditional ice cream and peanut butter (or any nut butter of your choice) adds a delicious nutty flavor, plus a dose of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. This ice cream is rich in cancer-fighting nutrients, including fiber and potassium, a mineral that is low in most American diets. Cool off with this sweet and healthy treat!
