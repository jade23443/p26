Slice bananas into chunks and freeze on a flat sheet pan (with pieces separated so they don't stick together) until solid, for at least 1-2 hours.
Add the frozen bananas to blender or food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. This will take a few minutes with periodic pauses to stir/scrape down bananas in blender/food processor.
Once bananas have reached a creamy texture, add peanut butter, vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon and continue to blend.
Scoop into individual bowls and top with chopped peanuts.
Serve immediately.
